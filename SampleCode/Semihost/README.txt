To enable semihost, user must define "DEBUG_ENABLE_SEMIHOST" constant when build code with BSP.
This sample code is used to show how to print message/getchar on IDE debug environment.
It will echo all input character back on UART #1 of KEIL IDE.

In KEIL MDK, user need to open "View->Serial Window->UART #1" windows in debug mode.
In IAR Workbench, user need to open "View->Terminal I/O" in debug mode.

NOTE1: HardFault_Handler handler is implemented in retarget.c when semihost enabled.
NOTE2: Semihost only works with Nuvoton NuLink ICE Dongle.
